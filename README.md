Three NASA [Astrobee free-flying robots](https://nasa.gov/astrobee/) have been operating inside
the International Space Station (ISS) since 2019. This [`astrobee`](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee) repository contains source code for the Astrobee Robot Software, consisting of
the flight software that runs onboard the Astrobee robots, a software simulator, and supporting tools, primarily written in C++.

Astrobee's flight software performs vision-based localization,
provides autonomous navigation, docking and perching, manages various sensors
and actuators, and supports human-robot interaction with co-located astronauts via screen-based displays, light
signaling, and sound. The flight software is hosted on each Astrobee's three internal single board computers and
uses the open-source [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) framework as message-passing
middleware.  It provides a high-level [Astrobee Command API](https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/command_dictionary.html) for controlling the robot and has multiple operating modes. It can execute a plan (command sequence), individual operator commands (teleoperation), or commands from guest science code running onboard Astrobee.

The Astrobee Robot Software simulator, built using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), enables the flight software to be evaluated without the need for robot hardware. The supporting tools include a tool that processes ISS imagery to [build maps for Astrobee localization](https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/sparsemapping.html), along with many others.

Released separately, the Astrobee ground data system (GDS) includes Astrobee control station software that communicates with Astrobee flight software via the Data Distribution Service (DDS) network protocol over the ISS Ku-IP space-to-ground link. The control station is written primarily in Java using the Eclipse RCP framework. Source code is in the [`astrobee_gds`](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee_gds) repository, or you can download the [binary release](https://software.nasa.gov/software/ARC-17994-1B).

Together, the Astrobee Robot and Ground Software were the NASA Software of the Year Award Runner-Up in 2020!

The Astrobee Robot Software remains a work in progress. Please consult the
[release notes](https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/md_RELEASE.html) for the current list of features and limitations.

  <div><ul>
<li>Extensive <a href="https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/documentation.html" target="_blank">Extensive</a> documentation is auto-generated from the contents of this repository.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/albee/a-brief-guide-to-astrobee/raw/master/a_brief_guide_to_astrobee_latest.pdf" target="_blank">"A Brief Guide to Astrobeeâ€™s Flight Software is a good tutorial"</a>, with a particular emphasis on the advanced topic of modifying Astrobee's flight software to enable Guidance, Navigation, & Control (GN&C) research. (Note that most guest science can be implemented as an app that uses the <a href="https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/command_dictionary.html" target="_blank">Astrobee Command API</a> without modifying the flight software.)</li>

<li>The <a href="https://github.com/Pedro-Roque/astrobee_ros_demo" target="_blank">"Astrobee ROS Demo"</a> package provides a C++/Python interface to implement custom control methods in ROS.</li>

  <summary><h2>Guest Science</h2></summary>
  <div><ul>
<li>The ISS Astrobee Facility maintains a collection of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/guest-science-resources" target="_blank">resources for guest scientists</a>  interested in conducting research with Astrobee, including the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/irg-ff029-astrobee-guest-science-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Astrobee Guest Science Guide</a> overview.</li>
<li>
Guest science code that runs onboard Astrobee is usually hosted as an Android Java app running on Astrobee's high-level processor (HLP).</li>
<li>Guest science apps can use the [Astrobee Command API](https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/command_dictionary.html) through its Java bindings. The [`astrobee_android`](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee_android) repository contains source code for Astrobee services that run on the HLP, example guest science apps, as well as a [Guest Science Readme](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee_android/blob/master/guest_science_readme.md) and [Guest Science Developer Guide](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee_android/blob/master/gs_developer_guide.md) focused on HLP guest science apps.</li>

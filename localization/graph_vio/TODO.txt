- test pose node updater! (AA)
  - rename nodeupdater to nodeadder???
  - test timestamped node updater functions (A)
      - AddNode(const localization_common::Time timestamp, gtsam::NonlinearFactorGraph& factors) final;
        - test add same node? add invalid node time? (AA) 
          - add more expect member functions, clean up earlier tests
            - allow passing timestamp and pose manually
          - add function to check factor (AA)
          - add function to check noise (AB)
          - add function to cast factor to between factor! (AC)
          - add function to get between factor with certain keys from factors vec? (AB)
            - use this also for remove relative factors?
      - SlideWindow(const localization_common::Time oldest_allowed_timestamp,
                   const boost::optional<gtsam::Marginals>& marginals, const gtsam::KeyVector& old_keys,
                   const double huber_k, gtsam::NonlinearFactorGraph& factors) final;
          - use old keys as test
          - use oldest/latest/can update as test
          - test slidewindownewoldesttime before and after call!

- test combined nav state node updater! (AC)
  - popuate imu measurements!
  - test each timestamped node updater function?
      - or just ones unique to combined nav state?

  - how to add a second measurement to updater?????
    - add to imu measurement???

- update factor adders with changes described below
- compile graph vio!
- test graph vio!!! (AD)
- compiple graph loc! (AB)
  - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame!!!
- test graph loc!!! (AC)
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?

// Nice to have:
- change factor adders to store data until it is ready to create factors
 - avoids having to add factors with uninitialized keys!!
 - avoids having to use graph action completers!
 - Do this for graph localizer first???
    - add graphoptimizer2 that does this??
- add option to use isam2!

- change timestamped nodes to use timestamped set!
 - rename graph values to nodes!!
    - package, graph loc first
      - graph vio later
  - avoid using graph values!
- add other parts from inv depth branch?
  - make sliding window graph optimizer? seperate from graph?
  - add abilitiy to compute covariances?
  - avoid having to use graph action completers?
  - add option to use isam instead of levenberg marq!!!

- move graph action completers to new package?
  - or remove altogether....
    - see inv depth branch? does this do that?
move combinednavstate accesors to combinednavstate node updater????
  - update graph vio with this!!

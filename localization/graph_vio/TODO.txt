    - test measurement based factor adder! (AA)
      - make simple example factor adder!
        - add priors for each timestamp! (AB)

  - implement loc factor adder!
    - move graph action completer here if needed!
  - implement vo factor adder!
    - move graph action completer here if needed!
  - test loc and vo factor adders?
  - test stnadstill factor adder???
  - TODO: implement others!

- make graph optimizer class depend on facter adder and node updater packages??

  - update graph optimizer!  (A)  
    - add single nodes to graph optimizer!!! (AAA)
      - construct in consctructor
      - pass these around to each node updater!
    - update factor adder interface (AAC)
      - add measurement buffering!
      - start with standstill factor adder!!
      - map-based pose adder!
    - make sure this all compiles
  - rename newoldesttime to newstarttime (node updaters, optimizer, etc) (AAB)
  - add test with graph optimizer, simple factor adder, and simple node updater!!
  - " " with sliding window graph optimizer!

- update factor adders with changes described below (A)
  - smart factor adder (AB)
    - remove factors to add, key info, etc (AAA)
      - use VIO node updater! (AAA)
    - add graph action completer code here! (AAB)
      - move from graph_vio
    - how to remove old measurements in factor adder?
    - test??
  - standstill factor adder (AC)
    - use VIO node updater!
  - map-based pose adder (AD)
    - use pose node updater!
- move post graph add actions to factor adders!
- update graph_optimizer??? test??
- remove graph_values package
  - rename refs to values to nodes!
- compile graph vio!
- test graph vio!!! (AD)
- compiple graph loc! (AB)
  - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame!!!
- test graph loc!!! (AC)
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- make work with isam and gtsam!
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?

// Nice to have:
- change factor adders to store data until it is ready to create factors
 - avoids having to add factors with uninitialized keys!!
 - avoids having to use graph action completers!
 - Do this for graph localizer first???
    - add graphoptimizer2 that does this??
- add option to use isam2!

- change timestamped nodes to use timestamped set!
 - rename graph values to nodes!!
    - package, graph loc first
      - graph vio later
  - avoid using graph values!
- add other parts from inv depth branch?
  - make sliding window graph optimizer? seperate from graph?
  - add abilitiy to compute covariances?
  - avoid having to use graph action completers?
  - add option to use isam instead of levenberg marq!!!

- move graph action completers to new package?
  - or remove altogether....
    - see inv depth branch? does this do that?
move combinednavstate accesors to combinednavstate node updater????
  - update graph vio with this!!

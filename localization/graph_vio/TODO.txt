- use timestamped node/node updater for graph loc!
  - finish making timestamped pose node updater!! (AAA)
    - add timestamp to add initial values and priors
    - add timestamp to addpriors
    - add removepriors function 
    - add slidewindownewoldesttime fcn
      - what does this do?
    - add old keys fcn
      - what does this do?
    - add getkeyfunction -> change interface??
    - add update function!
  - test timestamped pose node updater!
- compiple graph loc!
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
- add unit tests?
- test!
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????


// Nice to have:
 -move combinednavstate accesors to combinednavstate node updater????
  - update graph vio with this!!
- update combined nav state node update to use timestamped nodes!
    - steal from inv depth branch!
    - steal updated test from there as well!
    - remove graph values! replace with nodes! (need to do more work first? need to update feature point stuff?)
- rename graph values to nodes!!
    - package, graph loc first
      - graph vio later
  - avoid using graph values?
- add other parts from inv depth branch?
  - make sliding window graph optimizer? seperate from graph?
  - add abilitiy to compute covariances?
  - avoid having to use graph action completers?
  - add option to use isam instead of levenberg marq!!!

- move graph action completers to new package?
  - or remove altogether....
    - see inv depth branch? does this do that?

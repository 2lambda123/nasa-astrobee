- gt creation:
  4 min 13 sec per image for matching
      - 75 threads for ba
      - images per bag: 6847 before remove low momemvent, 545 after
      - images per surf base map: 2969!!!
      - TODO: why is it only matching to last 1000 images in surf base map?? 
        - starts with image 2970, not continuous but in increasing number (skips some numbers), goes to image 3
        - what is asearch vs b search when finding matching tracks?? 
          - search containers, cid_to_cid map for finding matches
      - TODO: test with maxed threads, much faster matching per image?? 
          - max threads (96) (0 image speed): 6m 49 sec
          - 75 threads: 6m 20 sec 
      - TODO: change jacobian to be analytic! (AB)
      - TODO: find smaller base surf map????
        - check sizes of other gt surf maps in maps dir! what is the range? (AA)
          - 2972, similar

- update tutorial with simple loc and odom!
  - update simple localizer section!
  - add simple odometry section!

  - add tutorial for simple calibration (AACC)
  - add tutorial for simple mapping (AADD)
    - add examples package! make sure these compile!!!
      - add unit tests for these!!!!

- start plotting VIO!
    - finish plot vio script! 
            - add initilizing first vio value using groundtruth value! (B)
              - make all future poses relative to this!
                - add function to do this??
            
            - add integrated velocities plot! (C)

            - add plotting num features! (D)
              - how to get num detected features???

            - add plotting acceleration values? (these come from imu messages....) (A)
              - bias corrected? raw?
            - add plotting angular acceleration values! (B)
              - bias corrected? raw?
 
    - add comments!
    - rename pose node adder to relative pose node adder??
      - update comments/readme/test/documentation?
    - update readme!

- add regression tests?

- update nodes interface!
  - remove or update closestnode, lowerandupperboundnodes, oldnodes
      - remove or return timestamped nodes! (no one uses these...)

- standstill factors added using all timestamps (AB)
  - should only spaced ones be used? adds more keys at timestamps between vo stamps!

- dont add successive points in smart factors that are too close together

offline replay:
  - allow for vio msg delay? run vio first, buffer vio msgs, then run graph loc?
  - plot_graph_bag
    - plot graph vio!!!! (AAA)
    - plot graph loc!
    - plot velocities and biases!
      - need to convert velocity frame in graph bag tool as well before integrating!
    - plot extrapolated states!

- test in sim! (E)

 - add pose_extrapolator package?

  unit tests:
	ros_pose_extrapolator: update existing tests
        ros_graph_vio: imu bias initializatoin? state changes? etc?
        graph_vio: standstill code? others?
        graph_localizer: system tests?
    - add test for avoid getting covariance for first node in newly slid window if it hasn't been included in optiization yet
    - add test in base class optimizer for accessing invalid covariance for key that hasn't been optimized!
    - add test in sliding window optimizer for removing old measurements from cumulative factors!
    - add test in sliding window optimizer for removing factors with old measurements!
    - add test to remove nodes using key vector! make sure this works! (AC)


  - graph vio:
    - add better way of getting relative covariance??
	- improve pose interpolator covariance calcualtion (relative and interpolated?)
	- others?

  ros_pose_extrapolator:
    - improve covariances!! use loc covariance! use relative covariance!

  - add sanity checkers to loc!
    - drift wrt vl measurements

  - ros_graph_vio_wrapper:
    - add rest of opt stats to graph_vio

  - ros graph vio nodelet:
    - TODO: only publish states message if optimization has occured again!
        - add indicator for this in graph optimizer? last optimize time? optimize count?

  - ros graph loc nodelet:
    - add rest of opt stats to graph loc message in ros_Graph_loc_wraper!

  isam2 optimizer issues!
    - need to account for values removed when sliding window!
      - since these have keys, just check for removed keys!
    - need to account for factors removed when sliding window!
      (i.e. smart factors!)
        - since these are pts, just make sets of ptr values and check for new and removed ones!!!

  - add ordering back to sliding window optimizer now that window is slid after optimization!

  - TODO: implement others!

- TODO: how to access opt iterations????

- send pose/cov history from vio, add all poses/covs in pose node (update old values) (C)
  - add support for this in timestamped_set? (updating old values)

- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- move serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages??
- initialize vio graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
    - is this actually necessary? graph vio in AstroLoc worked fine...
 - rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester

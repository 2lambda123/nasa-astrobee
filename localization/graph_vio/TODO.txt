  - update graph vio with this!!
- compiple graph loc!
- move graph action completers to new package?
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!

    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag

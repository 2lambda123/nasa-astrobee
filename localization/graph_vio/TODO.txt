  - implement loc factor adder! (AB)
    - add serialization!
      - also add to standstill factor adder! base class factor adders! others!
    - test vo factor adder! (AA)
      - update feature tracker to use timestamped set! test this!
        - make base class with basic features, child class with features for smart factor!
          - call these smart_factor_feature_tracks, smart_factor_feature_tracker, move to factor adder??
              - test spaced feature track! (AAA)
              - spit up feature tracker into feature tracker and spaced feature tracker
                - test featuretracker!
                - test spaced feature tracker!
          - test each of these!
        - add comments to functions!
      - clean up smart factor fixing code! test this!
        - add better comments to functions!
      - test other smart factor functions!
    - test loc factor adder!
  - test graph optimizer! (C)
  - test sliding window optimizer! (D)


  isam2 optimizer issues!
    - need to account for values removed when sliding window!
      - since these have keys, just check for removed keys!
    - need to account for factors removed when sliding window!
      (i.e. smart factors!)
        - since these are pts, just make sets of ptr values and check for new and removed ones!!!

  - add ordering back to sliding window optimizer now that window is slid after optimization!

  - TODO: implement others!
  - cleanup feature tracker!
    - should use timestamped set!
    - explain functions better!

  - add grah_vio! (E)
    - publish odometry message!
      - add new message type?
  - add graph_localizer! (F)
    - use pose node updater with odometry message! 
    - add loc factor adder!

- TODO: how to access opt iterations????
- move serialization.cc back to graph optimizer?
      - make graph optimizer depend on graph_Factors?
  - add test with graph optimizer, simple factor adder, and simple node updater!!
- add parameter reader package!!!!
  - how to unit test these??
- add option to use isam in graph optimizer????

- update factor adders with changes described below (A)
  - smart factor adder (AB)
    - remove factors to add, key info, etc (AAA)
      - use VIO node updater! (AAA)
    - add graph action completer code here! (AAB)
      - move from graph_vio
    - how to remove old measurements in factor adder?
    - test??
  - standstill factor adder (AC)
    - use VIO node updater!
  - map-based pose adder (AD)
    - use pose node updater!
- move post graph add actions to factor adders!
- compile graph vio!
- test graph vio!!! (AD)
- compiple graph loc! (AB)
  - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame!!!
- test graph loc!!! (AC)
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- make work with isam and gtsam!
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?

// Nice to have:
- change factor adders to store data until it is ready to create factors
 - avoids having to add factors with uninitialized keys!!
 - avoids having to use graph action completers!
 - Do this for graph localizer first???
    - add graphoptimizer2 that does this??
- add option to use isam2!

- change timestamped nodes to use timestamped set!
 - rename graph values to nodes!!
    - package, graph loc first
      - graph vio later
  - avoid using graph values!
- add other parts from inv depth branch?
  - make sliding window graph optimizer? seperate from graph?
  - add abilitiy to compute covariances?
  - avoid having to use graph action completers?
  - add option to use isam instead of levenberg marq!!!

- move graph action completers to new package?
  - or remove altogether....
    - see inv depth branch? does this do that?
move combinednavstate accesors to combinednavstate node updater????
  - update graph vio with this!!

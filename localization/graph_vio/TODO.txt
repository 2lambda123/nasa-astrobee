  - implement loc factor adder! (AB)
    - add serialization!
      - also add to standstill factor adder! base class factor adders! others!

 
    - update node adders to take nodes on construction!!!!
      - add another constructor in node adders that take nodes instead of nodestype
      - remove default nodes!
      - remove default nodes in timestamped_combind_nodes!
      - add shared_ptr<nodes> to node_Adder base class? add constructor that takes nodes?
    - clean up factor adder paarams??
      - too many copies in base classes?
  - test sliding window optimizer! (A)
    - need to change removefactors function! make exception for smart factors! (A)
        - test this!!!!
      - fix bugs in test!! (AA)
     - Update
      - add factors, update, make sure old factors are removed!
        - tune graph size based on pose node adder duration!
        - how to control adding priors?
            - in node adder!!
        - test new start time/end time!
          - add a second dummy node adder that simply sets these, make sure it works!
        - todo to test adding marginal factors?

  - test optimizers!!
      - test nonlinear optimizer! (B)
  - remove types from node adders! not needed!

  - send pose/cov history from vio, add all poses/covs in pose node (update old values) (C)
      - add support for this in timestamped_set? (updating old values)

  - add grah_vio! (E)
    - publish odometry message!
      - add new message type?
      - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame??
        - is velocity in global frame or body frame??
      - add better way of getting relative covariance??
  - add graph_localizer! (F)
    - use pose node updater with odometry message! 
    - add loc factor adder!

    - add parameter reader!
      - fail if parameter not read!!
      - how to unit test these??



  isam2 optimizer issues!
    - need to account for values removed when sliding window!
      - since these have keys, just check for removed keys!
    - need to account for factors removed when sliding window!
      (i.e. smart factors!)
        - since these are pts, just make sets of ptr values and check for new and removed ones!!!

  - add ordering back to sliding window optimizer now that window is slid after optimization!

  - TODO: implement others!



- TODO: how to access opt iterations????
- move serialization.cc back to graph optimizer?
      - make graph optimizer depend on graph_Factors?
  - add test with graph optimizer, simple factor adder, and simple node updater!!

- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?

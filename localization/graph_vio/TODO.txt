  - implement loc factor adder! (AB)
    - add serialization!
      - also add to standstill factor adder! base class factor adders! others!
        
    - test vo factor adder! (AA)
      - add simple test to make sure all factors are added!
            - add test to make sure pose keys in factor are correct! (AB)
              - make sure noise is correct? other parts of factor?
        - test adding factors with spacing!
      - test most params! make sure they work!
  - test loc factor adder!
  - test graph optimizer! (C)
  - test sliding window optimizer! (D)


  isam2 optimizer issues!
    - need to account for values removed when sliding window!
      - since these have keys, just check for removed keys!
    - need to account for factors removed when sliding window!
      (i.e. smart factors!)
        - since these are pts, just make sets of ptr values and check for new and removed ones!!!

  - add ordering back to sliding window optimizer now that window is slid after optimization!

  - TODO: implement others!

  - add grah_vio! (E)
    - publish odometry message!
      - add new message type?
  - add graph_localizer! (F)
    - use pose node updater with odometry message! 
    - add loc factor adder!

- TODO: how to access opt iterations????
- move serialization.cc back to graph optimizer?
      - make graph optimizer depend on graph_Factors?
  - add test with graph optimizer, simple factor adder, and simple node updater!!
- add parameter reader package!!!!
  - fail if parameter not read!!
  - how to unit test these??

  - smart factor adder (AB)
    - how to remove old measurements in factor adder?
- compile graph vio!
- test graph vio!!! (AD)
- compiple graph loc! (AB)
  - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame!!!
- test graph loc!!! (AC)
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?

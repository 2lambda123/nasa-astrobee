  - add parameter reader! (A)
      - finish factor adders! (AA)
      - add others!
          nodes
          node adders
          vision common
          graph vio
          graph localizer
          ros graph vio
          ros graph localizer 
          ....

      - fail if parameter not read!!
      - how to unit test these??

  - need to update imu augmentor to subscribe to both odom and loc! (B)
      - extrapolate loc with odom!
      - then extrapolate this with imu data!
      - rename!

  - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame before writing ekf message?? (C) 
    - is velocity in global frame or body frame??

   - test in sim! (D)

  - graph vio:
    - add better way of getting relative covariance??

  - add sanity checkers to loc!
    - drift wrt vl measurements

  - ros_graph_vio_wrapper:
    - add rest of opt stats to graph_vio

  - ros graph vio nodelet:
    - TODO: only publish states message if optimization has occured again!
        - add indicator for this in graph optimizer? last optimize time? optimize count?

  - ros graph loc nodelet:
    - add rest of opt stats to graph loc message in ros_Graph_loc_wraper!

  isam2 optimizer issues!
    - need to account for values removed when sliding window!
      - since these have keys, just check for removed keys!
    - need to account for factors removed when sliding window!
      (i.e. smart factors!)
        - since these are pts, just make sets of ptr values and check for new and removed ones!!!

  - add ordering back to sliding window optimizer now that window is slid after optimization!

  - TODO: implement others!

- TODO: how to access opt iterations????

- send pose/cov history from vio, add all poses/covs in pose node (update old values) (C)
  - add support for this in timestamped_set? (updating old values)

- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- move serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages??
- initialize vio graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
    - is this actually necessary? graph vio in AstroLoc worked fine...
 - rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?
- rename imu_augmentor to ros_imu_augmentor

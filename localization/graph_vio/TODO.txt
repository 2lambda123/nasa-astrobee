  - when reset localizer, wait until initial pose is received!!! (AA) 
      - add logic in wrapper for this!
      - also wait until vo message is received??
      - what happens if there's a gap in vo messages???
        - reset localizer???

  - graph vio:
    - support checking for standstill!!! (B)
    - add better way of getting relative covariance??

  - add parameter reader! (C)
      - fail if parameter not read!!
      - how to unit test these??

  - add sanity checkers to loc!

  - ros_graph_vio_wrapper:
    - add rest of opt stats to graph_vio
    - convert velocity from odom frame to global frame?? 
            - is velocity in global frame or body frame??

  - ros graph vio nodelet:
    - TODO: only publish states message if optimization has occured again!
        - add indicator for this in graph optimizer? last optimize time? optimize count?

  - ros graph loc nodelet:
    - add rest of opt stats to graph loc message in ros_Graph_loc_wraper!

  - need to update imu augmentor to subscribe to both odom and loc! (C)
      - extrapolate loc with odom!
      - then extrapolate this with imu data!
      - rename!


  - test in sim! (E)

  isam2 optimizer issues!
    - need to account for values removed when sliding window!
      - since these have keys, just check for removed keys!
    - need to account for factors removed when sliding window!
      (i.e. smart factors!)
        - since these are pts, just make sets of ptr values and check for new and removed ones!!!

  - add ordering back to sliding window optimizer now that window is slid after optimization!

  - TODO: implement others!

- TODO: how to access opt iterations????

- send pose/cov history from vio, add all poses/covs in pose node (update old values) (C)
  - add support for this in timestamped_set? (updating old values)

- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- how to add a second measurement to combined nav node update model????? (AE)
  - why is this needed???
    - fan rate!!!!!!
  - add to imu measurement???
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????
- rename pimpredict in other packages to extrapolate 
  - tools: loc rvz plugins, imu bias tester
- update imu_augmentor, make sure it compiles!
  - add tests?
- rename imu_augmentor to ros_imu_augmentor

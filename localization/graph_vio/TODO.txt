- update combinednavstatenodeupdater to use timestamped node updater and timestamped nodes!
  - test combinednavstatenodes! (AB)
    - fix combinednavstatenodeupdatemodel! (AA)
      - construct noise vec in param loading!
      - construct start node somewhere else!
    - update combined nav state node updater! (AC)
      - test and compile!
- test timestamped pose node updater! (AE)
  - add more functions (removing measurements, showing if it's ready to add a node at a timestamp, add measurements, etc.) to timestamped node updater! 
      - add to node update model???
- remove latest imu integrator!
  - update imu integrator to use timestamped set for imu measurements!
  - remove from graph_vio!
  - use own pim params in integrated pim call!
-  remove makecombinedimufactor function in imu integration!
- update factor adders with changes described below
- compile graph vio!
- test graph vio!!! (AD)
- compiple graph loc! (AB)
- test graph loc!!! (AC)
- add graph vio to graph bag!
  - run_graph_Bag, plot_graph_bag
  - use graph bag???? 
    - copy graph bag and run for VIO only?? Or modify current graph bag tool??
      - (probably modify current tool?)
- move param loading and serialization from graph_vio/loc to respective packages!
- initialize graph with identity pose, set fixed!!!
  - TODO: need to always have fixed identity pose as origin! how to do this?
    - set start pose fixed after maginalize????


// Nice to have:
- change factor adders to store data until it is ready to create factors
 - avoids having to add factors with uninitialized keys!!
 - avoids having to use graph action completers!
 - Do this for graph localizer first???
    - add graphoptimizer2 that does this??
- add option to use isam2!

- change timestamped nodes to use timestamped set!
 - rename graph values to nodes!!
    - package, graph loc first
      - graph vio later
  - avoid using graph values!
- add other parts from inv depth branch?
  - make sliding window graph optimizer? seperate from graph?
  - add abilitiy to compute covariances?
  - avoid having to use graph action completers?
  - add option to use isam instead of levenberg marq!!!

- move graph action completers to new package?
  - or remove altogether....
    - see inv depth branch? does this do that?
move combinednavstate accesors to combinednavstate node updater????
  - update graph vio with this!!
